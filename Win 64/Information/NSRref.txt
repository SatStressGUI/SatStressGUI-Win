Nonsynchronous rotation (NSR) occurs when a satellite's lithosphere is decoupled from its core. When this happens, the tidal bulge of the shell causes it to experience a net torque, and could rotate more quickly than the synchronous rate. Thus, the planet appears to move across the sky, and the tidal bulge moves beneath the shell. This results in surface stresses.
The period of this rotation should be > 10,000 years.
