A satellite's obliquity (or axial tilt) is the angle between it rotational axis and its orbital axis. A satellite of zero obliquity will have a rotational axis perpendicular to its orbital plane. However, when the obliquity is nonzero, it causes the stresses due to diurnal tides and non-synchronous rotation to be asymmetric.
