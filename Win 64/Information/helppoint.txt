The Point Tab can be used to calculate the stress at any discrete point in space and time.

- Enter a latitude, longitude, year, and orbital position for each point.
- Press the "Calculate Stress" button.
- Use the "Save to File" button to save the results as a .cvs file.

- θ: latitude (-90.00 to 90.00) [°]
- φ: longitude (-180.00 to180.00 (positive West or East to choose from)) [°]
- t: time since periapse (periapse = 0) [yrs], used for secular stress calculations
- orbital pos: orbital position since periapse (periapse = 0) [°], used for diurnal stress calculations
- Stt: east-west component of stress field [kPa]
- Spt: off diagonal component of stress field [kPa]
- Spp: north-south component of stress field [kPa]
- σ1: maximum tension [kPa]
- σ3: maximum compression [kPa]
- α: the angle between σ1 and due north (clockwise is positive) [°]
