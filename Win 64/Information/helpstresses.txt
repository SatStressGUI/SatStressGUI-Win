The Stresses Tab is used to select which stresses to use.

- For Diurnal and NSR stresses, the h2, k2, and l2 boxes should be left blank unless the user wants to input their own values. Checking the "Input Love Numbers" box will allow you to use custom Love numbers. When inputting custom love numbers, you must use the format <Re> +/- <Im>j. Do not use scientific notation. For example, "1.2+3.0e-5j" should be written as "1.2+0.00003j."
- If left blank, the program will use .65 as the value for the Stefan Parameter in Ice Shell Volume Change.
- Polar Wander uses an elastic, time-independent calculation, so it should probably not be used with other stresses.
- By turning on the "Assume tidally locked satellite" option, the program will calculate the tidal axis as always perpendicular to the rotational axis.
- If you turn off the tidal locking option and the plot does not update, press 'Enter' in each of the tidal axis text boxes.
- Activating the "Despinning" box allows the user to change the initial and final rotation rate of the satellite. The rotational period should be input in units of hours.
- All coordinates should be input as latitude and longitude; conversion to colatitude is handled by the program.
